# SnakeGame
This is a SnakeGame which i have made as a Winter Project in my holidays.
It is derived from someplaces in the internet as a base work and then
i have worked on it adding more features like the assist and color modules

Some of the added and worked features are inputing name from the user,
giving assist mode, different difficulty level and colors of the snake

Created more code modularity for same type of function , like the font,
avoiding repeated coding and having neat code.

Made different files and tried to make my code human readable
also made more generalized methods and classes.
